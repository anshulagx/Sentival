Bathrooms - there are no stand alone bathrooms. Please consider this - you have to clear out the main bedroom to use that bathroom. Other option is you walk through a different bedroom to get to its en-suite. Signs all over the apartment - there are signs everywhere - some helpful - some telling you rules. Perhaps some people like this but It negatively affected our enjoyment of the accommodation. Stairs - lots of them - some had slightly bending wood which caused a minor injury."
